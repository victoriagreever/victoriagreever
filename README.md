## Hi! I'm Victoria Greever.
### I'm a third year at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Biotechnology and Molecular Bioscience with a minor in Museum Studies. I'm interested in bioinformatics and scientific communication, examining how scientists can more effectively communicate ideas to people with non-scientific backgrounds.
